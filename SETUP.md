# Setup Instructions

## Initial Scaffolding Complete

All project files have been created. You're ready to start development!

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify the Build

```bash
cd ~/Developer/devspace
cargo build
```

This should download dependencies and compile successfully.

### 2. Test the CLI

```bash
cargo run -- --help
```

You should see help output showing all commands.

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

All integration tests should pass (they test the TODO stubs).

### 4. Review the Structure

Key files to review:
- `Cargo.toml` - Dependencies and project metadata
- `src/cli.rs` - CLI structure (commands, subcommands)
- `src/commands/mod.rs` - Command implementations (currently stubs)
- `ASSISTANT.md` - Full context for AI coding assistants
- `NOTES.md` - Development roadmap and decisions
- `README.md` - Project overview

### 5. Start Development

Ready to begin Phase 2 (Core Infrastructure). Start with:

```bash
# Create a new Claude Code session in this directory
# The agent will have full context from ASSISTANT.md

# First task: Implement TOML manifest parsing
# See NOTES.md "Phase 2" for details
```

### 6. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial devspace scaffolding

- Rust project with Cargo.toml
- CLI structure with clap
- Command scaffolding (no-ops)
- Integration tests
- GitHub Actions for CI
- Comprehensive context in ASSISTANT.md and NOTES.md

Ready to begin Phase 2: Core infrastructure implementation."

git push origin main
```

## File Overview

### Core Files
- `src/main.rs` - Entry point, initializes tracing and CLI
- `src/cli.rs` - Clap-based CLI definitions
- `src/commands/mod.rs` - Command dispatcher (all TODO stubs)
- `src/lib.rs` - Library interface

### Documentation
- `README.md` - User-facing overview
- `ASSISTANT.md` - AI assistant context (comprehensive!)
- `NOTES.md` - Development notes and roadmap
- `SETUP.md` - This file

### Tests
- `tests/integration/cli_test.rs` - Integration tests for all commands

### CI/CD
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions for testing and building

### Configuration
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies and project config
- `.gitignore` - Generated by `gh` (Rust template)
- `LICENSE` - MIT license (generated by `gh`)

## What's Next

1. **Phase 2**: Implement core infrastructure
   - TOML parsing
   - Platform detection
   - Error types
   - XDG helpers
   - See NOTES.md for details

2. **Phase 3**: Port features from shell implementation
   - Reference: `/Users/acarter/.local/share/dev`
   - Start with profile loading
   - Then symlink management
   - Then UBI backend
   - See NOTES.md for priority order

3. **Testing**: Write tests as you implement
   - Unit tests in same file as code
   - Integration tests in `tests/`
   - Follow patterns in `cli_test.rs`

4. **Documentation**: Keep docs updated
   - rustdoc comments for public APIs
   - Update README with progress
   - Update NOTES.md with decisions

## Context Preservation

The shell implementation at `/Users/acarter/.local/share/dev` is your reference:
- Check it for behavior questions
- Port features one at a time
- Maintain manifest format compatibility
- Improve where Rust enables it

ASSISTANT.md has full context - any AI coding assistant can pick up from there.

## Getting Help

- Check ASSISTANT.md for architecture and patterns
- Check NOTES.md for current status and decisions
- Reference shell implementation for behavior
- Run `cargo doc --open` for dependency docs
- See Rust resources in NOTES.md

Ready to code! ðŸ¦€
