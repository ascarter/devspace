# Claude Agent Guide

Welcome! Use [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) as the authoritative checklist for working on this repository. It points to `README.md` for product context and `docs/architecture.md` for deeper technical details.

Minimum workflow for Claude Code:
1. Skim `AGENTS.md` â†’ follow structure, commands, and style rules.
2. Review any task-specific files plus the sections of `docs/architecture.md` referenced by the handbook.
3. Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` before proposing changes.
4. Add or update tests as directed in `AGENTS.md`.

If something in the docs appears stale, update `AGENTS.md` first so every agent stays in sync. Ping a human for conflicting requirements or destructive actions. Good luck!
